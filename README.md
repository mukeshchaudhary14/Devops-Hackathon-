## 📋 Dockerfile Explanation  

### **Basic Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
# Pull base image
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy app source code
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Expose the port used by Vite
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the development server
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```
Run the following command to build and run the image:
```sh
docker build -t online-shop:v1 .
docker run -p 3000:5173 online-shop:v1
```

### **Docker Multi-Stage Build**
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Install dependencies using Alpine for minimal size
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json for efficient caching
COPY package*.json ./

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy the rest of the app source code
COPY . .

# Stage 2: Use smallest distroless image for runtime
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy built app and node_modules from builder
COPY --from=builder /app /app

# Expose the port used by Vite
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the app
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```
### Benefits of Multi-Stage Build:
- 📉 **Reduced image size** (~386MB from ~426MB)
- 🔐 **Minimal attack surface** using distroless image
